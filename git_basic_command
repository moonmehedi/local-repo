git clone https://github.com/moonmehedi/Moon.git


cd .\Moon.\ moving //terminal inside folder

git status //tells status about the project

change something in project and run thus code

as i modified a file now i have to follow 2 step process 
1/add
2/commit


3 types of files
1/untracked: new file that git does not yet track
2/modified: changed file

3/staged: file is ready to be committed
4/unmodified: unchanged


add command:adds new or changed file
    git add <file name>

    git add . //will add all files

commit : it is the record of change
    git commit -m "some message related to commit"

this will save the changes in local machine
to make it visible in git hub we have to use push


push : upload local repo content to remote repo
    git push origin name

now if we refresh our browser we will see the changes it our github

adding repositories to git

init command: making current a folder a git repo
    git init

git remote add origin <link> //adding origin or repo for the project

adding origin for this project
seeing the current repo or origin

git remote -v

git branch : tells about the branch name

git branch -M main :rename branch to main


workflop

first create a file on github
make clone
do change

commit

CREATING NEW BRANCH
git checkout -b <branch name>
{branchers are clones of project people(developed designer etc) will create their branch and work on it later they can merge their branch}


MOVING TO ANOTHER BRANCH
git checkout <branch name>


DELETING A BRANCH
git branch -d <branch name>

PUSHING BRANCH
    git push origin <branch name>
    git push origin <feature>

MARGING BRANCH TO MAIN

git diff <branch name>
git merge main (merging feature to main or branch to main)
